# Balanced-Mixture-of-Supernets-for-Learning-CNN-Pooling

In this repository we release PyTorch code to replicate all main results, images and tabels presented in the paper: Balanced Mixture of Supernets for Learning the CNN Pooling Architecture

## Getting Started
### Install
It's recommended to use Python3 and create a virtual environment first
To run the the experiments install the following packages:

'''
./install.sh
'''

For ResNet18 and ResNet50 experiments, datasets need to be converted to FFCV format. To download and convert them for CIFAR100 run:
