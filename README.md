# Balanced-Mixture-of-Supernets-for-Learning-CNN-Pooling

This repository contains the of release PyTorch code to replicate all main results, figures and tabels presented in the paper: Balanced Mixture of Supernets for Learning the CNN Pooling Architecture

The repository structure is as followed:
  * `figures/`contains all figures represented in paper 
  * `results/`contains raw results of our tests
  * `CIFAR`,


## Structure of Respository


## Getting Started
### Install
It's recommended to use Python3 and create a virtual environment first
To run the the experiments install the following packages:

```bash
$ ./install.sh
```

For ResNet18 and ResNet50 experiments, datasets need to be converted to FFCV format. To download and convert them for CIFAR100 run.
